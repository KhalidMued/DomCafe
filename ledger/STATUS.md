## Current branch
docs/status-phase5-merged

## What works
- Phase 2 PR #5 was merged into `main` and local `main` was fast-forwarded.
- Phase 3 PR #6 created the Docker Compose runtime foundation.
- Phase 3 PR #7 hardened env/secret handling.
- Phase 3 PR #8 added PostgreSQL/PgBouncer backup and restore tooling.
- Phase 3 PR #9 added backend health, DB readiness checks, and runtime smoke tests.
- Phase 3 PR #10 added structured backend logging, request IDs, and Nginx access logs. (Correction 2026-07-08: the backend logging/request-ID middleware is no longer present in the current code; only Nginx access logs and uvicorn defaults remain. Tracked as finding M6 in `ledger/AUDIT-2026-07-08.md`.)
- Phase 3 PR #11 added Postgres persistent volume plus Redis-backed app caching.
- Phase 3 PR #12 added production deployment docs and operational runbook.
- Phase 4 PR #13 added the public ordering backend foundation.
- Phase 4 PR #14 added the public ordering frontend.
- Phase 4 PR #15 added the admin authentication and dashboard foundation.
- Phase 4 PR #16 added admin order management.
- Phase 4 PR #17 added admin menu availability management.
- Phase 4 PR #18 added protected admin drink photo uploads.
- Phase 4 PR #19 added protected admin drink copy/options editing.
- Phase 4 PR #20 added protected bean detail editing and cafe settings management.
- Phase 4 PR #21 added protected category editing, category availability, and expanded drink catalog editing.
- Phase 4 PR #22 added protected create/archive endpoints and `/admin/menu` UI controls for categories, beans, and drinks.
- Phase 5 PR #23 added the dedicated Herms/agent order-control API surface.
- Phase 5 PR #24 added the dedicated Herms/agent menu/bean lookup and availability-control API surface.
- Phase 5 PR #25 added Discord order notifications and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #26 made the Docker Compose Nginx entrypoint reachable over the private Tailscale network by binding only Nginx to `0.0.0.0:11080:80`; backend, PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, and Redis remain internal-only with no host port bindings.
- Phase 6 PR #27 added Nginx edge limits plus Redis-backed backend fallback fixed-window limits for high-risk write endpoints and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #28 allowed the Cloudflare Tunnel hostname `dom.khalidmued.com` through the Vite dev server host allowlist and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #29 documented the Cloudflare Tunnel service setup, verification commands, and network exposure model and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #30 resolved dependency audit findings and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #31 added the PgBouncer health check and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #32 completed final Phase 6 readiness checks and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #33 added the initial welcome hero polish and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #34 fixed the welcome-page overlap from the screenshot and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #35 polished menu cards and the empty-menu state and was merged into `main`.
- PR #36 recorded production `.env` verification and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #37 polished cart and order-status pages and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #38 restored the main/welcome page closer to the user's attached old simple card and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #39 separated the large white DŌM mark from the small orange `Home café` label and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #40 fixed the first DŌM wordmark rhythm issue with equal-width spans and a CSS macron overlay and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #41 tuned the CSS wordmark lockup and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #42 replaced the welcome wordmark/label/tagline block with the user-supplied inline SVG and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #43 moved the orange `HOME CAFÉ` label and its orange underline upward within the inline SVG and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #44 improved RTL/content-direction resilience and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #45 improved small interaction feedback and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #46 replaced the `/admin/login` splash header with the approved inline SVG lockup and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #47 fixed the initial blank-screen/slow-transition path with a production frontend container, immediate DŌM loading shell, and route-level lazy loading, and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #48 added a focused admin navigation header with Dashboard, Orders, Menu, Beans, and Settings links; added a visible Logout button that clears the stored admin token and returns to `/admin/login`; and added a dedicated `/admin/beans` page backed by the existing admin menu/beans API. It was merged into `main`.
- PR #49 recorded Phase 7 completion and the decision to defer optional Three.js. It was merged into `main`.
- PR #50 recorded the final MVP acceptance pass and was merged into `main`.
- PR #51 added the provided DŌM favicon pack to `frontend/public/`, linked browser favicon/touch/manifest metadata from `frontend/index.html`, kept favicon files out of the uploads/drink-photo pipeline, and was merged into `main`.
- The production frontend container was rebuilt after PR #51 merged so Nginx now serves the new favicon, PNG icons, Apple touch icon, and manifest files instead of the old SPA fallback HTML.
- PR #54 added the cart Remove control, centered select chevrons, and disabled textarea resizing; it was merged into `main` and the production frontend container was rebuilt afterward.
- PR #55 replaced the cart page native quantity number input with a custom minus/value/plus stepper, kept the minimum quantity at 1, and aligned the cart quantity badge plus Remove control to the Doum gold/fired-clay color treatment; it was merged into `main` and the production frontend container was rebuilt afterward.
- PR #58 (order progress on the menu plus upload-policy docs) was squash merged into `main`.
- PR #59 added `CLAUDE.md` with the permanent PR-only Git workflow rule and was squash merged into `main`.
- A full production-readiness audit was completed and recorded in `ledger/AUDIT-2026-07-08.md` with a five-phase remediation roadmap.
- Audit Phase 1 (PR #60) was squash merged into `main`: self-healing Compose stack (restart policies, healthchecks, health-gated `depends_on`), the GitHub Actions CI workflow, and the non-root backend image.
- Audit Phase 2 (PR #61) was squash merged into `main`: order enumeration blocked via random `public_code` lookups, real per-client rate limiting through `--proxy-headers`/`real_ip`, security headers restored on `/api/*` and `/uploads/*`, and whitespace-only guest names rejected.
- Audit Phase 3 (PR #62) was squash merged into `main`: order-progress resilience, defensive API error parsing, sessionStorage cart persistence, the quantity-10 cap, and self-hosted Tajawal fonts.
- Audit Phase 4 (PR #63) was squash merged into `main`: background Discord notifications, request-ID logging middleware, shared Redis client, explicit-null bean clearing, the dead-code sweep, and helper dedup.
- Audit Phase 5 (PR #64) was squash merged into `main`: admin SPA navigation without full page reloads (M11); order status transitions record `received_at`/`preparing_at`/`ready_at`/`cancelled_at` timestamps (M14, migration `20260708_0004`); cancelled progress-track styling, stable list keys, drink-photo alt text, and mid-tone→hint contrast fixes (L6); edge Nginx gzip for API JSON, server-side WebP re-encoding of drink photo uploads capped at 1600px with EXIF stripped, and one grouped dashboard order-count query (L7). L3 (deleting replaced photo files) was deliberately skipped: it conflicts with the curated-photo runtime-data policy, which forbids deleting admin-added photos without explicit confirmation.

## Verification
Verification for `feature/phase5-polish` (2026-07-08):

- Backend tests: `79 passed` (75 existing + 4 new in `test_phase10_polish.py` covering WebP re-encoding with the 1600px cap, non-image rejection, status-transition timestamp recording, and the grouped dashboard status counts) in a clean `python:3.12-slim` container.
- Frontend tests: `39 passed` (36 existing + 3 new in `polish.test.tsx` covering the cancelled progress track, drink-photo alt text, and SPA navigation from the logged-out admin state) and production build passed.
- `docker compose config -q` passed; the stack rebuilt healthy and migration `20260708_0004` was applied (`alembic current` reports it as head).
- Live gzip check: `GET /api/menu` with `Accept-Encoding: gzip` returned `Content-Encoding: gzip` through the edge Nginx.
- Live timestamp check: a verification order was moved `new → preparing → cancelled` through the shared `update_order_status` service (used by both admin and agent routes); `preparing_at` and `cancelled_at` were recorded as timezone-aware UTC values and `received_at` stayed null. The verification order was left cancelled.
- Incidental ops fix during verification: PgBouncer had gone unhealthy after an earlier Postgres restart (stale DNS for `postgres`, `pgbouncer cannot connect to server`); restarting the PgBouncer container restored `/api/health` to `ok`.

Historical verification for earlier merged work lives in git history of this file.

## What is pending
- Three.js is intentionally deferred for a later optional enhancement.

## Known issues
- The 2026-07-08 audit (`ledger/AUDIT-2026-07-08.md`) tracks the full prioritized list. H1–H4, M1–M11, M13–M14, L1–L2, and L6–L7 are fixed (Phases 2–5); still open by choice: M10 (localStorage JWT), M12 (retry/backoff/offline handling), L3 (old-photo deletion — conflicts with the curated-photo runtime-data policy), L4 (login timing oracle), L5 (PgBouncer plain auth, internal-only), and L8 (harmless in-container `env_file` path).
- Guests with an order in flight at Phase 2 deploy time lose their old `/order/<int id>` tracking link (integer lookups now 404 by design); new orders use unguessable codes.
- Empty guest-name Start action has no visible validation message.
- `/admin` falls back to the public welcome page instead of routing to admin login/dashboard.
- Many menu cards still use the repeated DŌM placeholder image.
- Long menu navigation can be improved after scrolling away from the category chips and review-order link.

## Next recommended task
- The 2026-07-08 audit roadmap is complete and merged. Next candidates: the smaller UX items under Known issues (empty guest-name validation message, `/admin` fallback route, menu navigation after scrolling) or the deferred M12 fetch retry/backoff work.

## Notes
- `.env` remains ignored and must not be committed.
- Do not expose local admin credentials, database passwords, JWTs, `AGENT_API_KEY`, Discord webhook URLs, tunnel credential JSON files, or connection strings.
- Runtime verification scripts should construct secrets in memory without printing them.
- Keep local dev data clean: restore smoke tests should use a temporary database and drop it after validation.
- The Cloudflare Tunnel uses `protocol: http2` because QUIC connections were unstable on this server/network during setup.
