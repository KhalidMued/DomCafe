## Current branch
ui/cart-status-polish

## What works

- Phase 3 PR #8 added PostgreSQL/PgBouncer backup and restore tooling.
- Phase 3 PR #9 added backend health, DB readiness checks, and runtime smoke tests.
- Phase 3 PR #10 added structured backend logging, request IDs, and Nginx access logs.
- Phase 3 PR #11 added Postgres persistent volume plus Redis-backed app caching.
- Phase 3 PR #12 added production deployment docs and operational runbook.
- Phase 4 PR #13 added the public ordering backend foundation.
- Phase 4 PR #14 added the public ordering frontend.
- Phase 4 PR #15 added the admin authentication and dashboard foundation.

- Phase 4 PR #21 added protected category editing, category availability, and expanded drink catalog editing.
- Phase 4 PR #22 added protected create/archive endpoints and `/admin/menu` UI controls for categories, beans, and drinks.
- Phase 5 PR #23 added the dedicated Herms/agent order-control API surface.
- Phase 5 PR #24 added the dedicated Herms/agent menu/bean lookup and availability-control API surface.
- Phase 5 PR #25 added Discord order notifications and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #26 made the Docker Compose Nginx entrypoint reachable over the private Tailscale network by binding only Nginx to `0.0.0.0:11080:80`; backend, PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, and Redis remain internal-only with no host port bindings.
- Phase 6 PR #27 added Nginx edge limits plus Redis-backed backend fallback fixed-window limits for high-risk write endpoints and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #28 allowed the Cloudflare Tunnel hostname `dom.khalidmued.com` through the Vite dev server host allowlist and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #29 documented the Cloudflare Tunnel service setup, verification commands, and network exposure model and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #30 resolved dependency audit findings and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #31 added the PgBouncer health check and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 6 PR #32 completed final Phase 6 readiness checks and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #33 added the initial welcome hero polish and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #34 fixed the welcome-page overlap from the screenshot and was merged into `main`.
- Phase 7 PR #35 polished menu cards and the empty-menu state and was merged into `main`.
- PR #36 recorded production `.env` verification and was merged into `main`.
- Current branch polishes the cart and order-status guest pages with clearer hero copy, a cart summary card, a proper empty-cart state/CTA, improved cart item controls, submitting state copy, order-status topline metadata, completed progress-step styling, and RTL-ready `dir="auto"` text fields.

## Verification
- Frontend tests: `25 passed`.
- Frontend production build: passed.
- Docker Compose rebuild/restart for frontend/Nginx path: passed.
- Local `/api/health` through Nginx: HTTP 200 with database and Redis OK.
- Tailscale `/api/health` through Nginx: HTTP 200 with database and Redis OK.
- Public `/api/health` through Cloudflare Tunnel: HTTP 200 with database and Redis OK.
- `/cart` route through Nginx: HTTP 200.
- `/order/41` SPA route through Nginx: HTTP 200.
- Browser smoke check for `/cart`: empty-cart summary, empty state, and Browse menu CTA render with readable spacing and no dangling order-note/submit controls.
- Browser smoke check for `/order/41`: status hero, friendly error, and loading card render with readable spacing and no obvious desktop layout defects.

## What is pending
- PR #37 (`ui/cart-status-polish`) is open for review and merge into `main`: https://github.com/KhalidMued/DomCafe/pull/37
- Remaining Phase 7 work after this branch: broader RTL review and optional lightweight Three.js welcome component only if it stays simple and performant.

## Notes
- `.env` remains ignored and must not be committed.
- Do not expose local admin credentials, database passwords, JWTs, `AGENT_API_KEY`, Discord webhook URLs, tunnel credential JSON files, or connection strings.
- Runtime verification scripts should construct secrets in memory without printing them.
- Keep local dev data clean: restore smoke tests should use a temporary database and drop it after validation.
- The Cloudflare Tunnel uses `protocol: http2` because QUIC connections were unstable on this server/network during setup.
